# Frontend Challenge vo2

### Installation

This project is built on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To install dependencies run `yarn install` in the root and to start the project run `yarn start`

### Technical choices

- create-react-app is used because it is the simplest way to scaffold a React project the has no server-side rendering requirement.
- react-router was chosen for routing as it is the most feature rich and easiest to use which makes it a very popular choice in the comunity.
- To handle page transitions I use react-transition-group because it is simple to use and can be used in a variety of contexts.
- Pre-commit hooks are used for code quality control.
- eslint and prettier are used to maintain code consistency.
- jest and enzyme are used for automated tests as they are the suggested tools when using create-react-app.
- I spend no time on styling as there was no design to follow and I didn't think it important for this project
